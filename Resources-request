esource Requirements
Scheduller (kube-scheduler) determines the amount of resources needed by a pod and those
available on the nde. the scheduller will schedule a pod on e.g node2. if no resources are 
available on all the nodes, the pod goes into a pending stage (insufficient CPUS(3)).
you can add memory and CPU in the pod-definition.yaml
throttle cpu (when it tries to exceed its limits), while the pod will be terminated if it exceeds 
its memory OOM error if it exceeds its memory.

DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR
this is important because resources available to the public can be used for crypto mining
which takes a lot of resources. 1 pod can consume all the resources on a node and starve the other
pods.

LIMIT RANGE
Resource Quotas: at namespace levels
1. a pod called rabbit is deployed. identify the CPU requirements set on the pod in the 
current (default)namespace
solution
K describe pod rabbit

2. Delete the rabbit pod. once deleted, wait for the pod to fully terminate.
solution
kubectl delete pod rabbit

3. another pod called elephant had ben deployed in the default namespace. if fails to get to
a running state. inspect this pod and identify the reason why it is not running.
solution
Kubectl describe pod elephanat
OOM killed!

4. the elephant pod runs a process that consumed 15Mi of memory. increase the limit of the elephant pod to 20Mi.
Delete and recreate the pod if required. Do not modify anything other than the required fields.
solution
kubectl get pod -o yaml> elephant.yaml
kubectl delete pod elephant
vi elephant.yaml
 kubectl apply -f elephant.yaml

5. inspect the status of the pod to make sure its running
